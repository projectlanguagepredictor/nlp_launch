# Programming Language Prediction

Project Description:
    Github is a version control system platform that projects and tracked and saved on, it acts a resource for professionals an students that use coding. README files provide summaries of those projects. Predicting the programming language based on Readme files can allow for efficient research and greater utility of github by users since users typically need projects that use specified languages.
    
## Project Goal:

The goal is to be able to predict programming languages based on terms used in README.md files.
    
## Initial Thoughts 

Many coding languages have overlap in use but each language may have a function that it's more often used for or better for than others which would means words in READMEs may vary.

   
## The Plan

     Acquire data from github
         Pull repos
         Convert to DataFrame
         Look at the dataset
     Prepare data
       
     Explore
         Split into Train, Validate, Test
         Start Visualizing Data
         Select most relevant and interesting visulaizations for final report
         Find out which features have the strongest relationship with the target variable
         Create hypothesis
         Create models
     Model
         Choose Evaluation Metric
         Baseline eval metric
         Fit and score model with Train
         Fit and score model with Validate
         Select best model
             Fit and score model with Test

     
## Explore data


## Develop a Model to predict assessed value

      Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types
      Evaluate models on train and validate data
      Select the best model based on the highest accuracy
      Evaluate the best model on test data

|                     |                                                           |
|                     |                                                           |
