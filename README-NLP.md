# Programming Language Prediction

Project Description:
    Programming languagesa vary in syntax, terminology, and utility. Completing
    
## Project Goal:

   
    
## Initial Thoughts 

   
## The Plan

     Acquire data from github
         Pull repos
         Convert to DataFrame
         Look at the dataset
         Create a data dictionary
     Prepare data
       
     Explore
         Split into Train, Validate, Test
         Start Visualizing Data
         Select most relevant and interesting visulaizations for final report
         Find out which features have the strongest relationship with the target variable
         Create hypothesis
         Create models
     Model
         Choose Evaluation Metric
         Baseline eval metric
         Fit and score model with Train
         Fit and score model with Validate
         Select best model
             Fit and score model with Test

     
## Explore data


## Develop a Model to predict assessed value

      Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types
      Evaluate models on train and validate data
      Select the best model based on the highest accuracy
      Evaluate the best model on test data
